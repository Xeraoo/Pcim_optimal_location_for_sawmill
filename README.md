## Objective
The objective of this project was to conduct a logical analysis to find the optimal location for a sawmill in the municipality of Pcim, considering the specified criteria while minimizing construction costs.

### Conditions in the Task
We decided to utilize the provided data included as course material for Project 1, “Antenna Distribution,” as these were already familiar to us, significantly speeding up the analysis process.

## Data Preparation
To properly execute this task, we utilized the dataset included in the “Topic 9” assignment. Based on the criteria established in the task, we completed the analysis and documented the process in the following sections.

## Summary
The project was successfully completed despite not meeting all the conditions in the municipality of Pcim as initially assumed. We were able to identify suitable locations in the vicinity of the municipality that meet all the criteria outlined in the project.

During the analysis, we encountered issues related to raster data processing in the QGIS environment, specifically with image conversion causing generalization artifacts, resulting in "stair-stepping" effects. Consequently, the boundaries of the municipality and the obtained images did not always align perfectly with the analyzed area. This necessitated the reclassification of data to ensure that the results could be effectively utilized in the further stages of the analysis. This also led to various errors, requiring us to execute some commands multiple times to achieve the desired outcome.
